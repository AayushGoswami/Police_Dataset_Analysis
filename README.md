# Police_Dataset_Analysis
The Police Dataset Analysis project utilizes Python and Pandas to process and analyze a dataset related to police activities. The project focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and extracting insights to understand patterns in law enforcement operations.

**Features**

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and dropping unnecessary columns.

Data Transformation: Converting data types and standardizing formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends and patterns in police activities.

Statistical Analysis: Calculating key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.

**Technologies Used**

Python (for data processing and analysis)

Pandas (for data manipulation and cleaning)

Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development and visualization)

**Future Improvements**

Implementing machine learning models for predictive analysis.

Creating interactive dashboards using Power BI or Metabase.

Expanding dataset coverage for deeper insights.
