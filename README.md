# Police Dataset Analysis Project

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a police stop dataset using Python and Pandas. The primary goal is to clean, transform, and explore the data to uncover patterns and insights related to law enforcement activities.

## Project Overview

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values and removes columns with only null values to ensure data quality.
- **Data Transformation:** Standardizes and converts data types, including mapping categorical durations to numeric values for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examines trends such as the frequency of stops by gender, the impact of gender on search likelihood, and the distribution of stop durations.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculates descriptive statistics (mean, value counts, etc.) for key variables, including stop duration and driver age by violation type.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for step-by-step analysis and visualization.

## How to Use

1. Ensure the dataset file (`Police dataset.csv`) is present in the project directory.
2. Open `Police_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.
3. Run the notebook cells in order to perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate machine learning models for predictive analytics.
- Develop interactive dashboards using visualization tools such as Power BI or Metabase.
- Expand the dataset for broader and deeper insights.
